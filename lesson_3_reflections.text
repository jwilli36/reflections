1.When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
You would want to see a remote repository when working in teams, so other members can see changes that are taking place for the 
task

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 You may want to pull changes manually because you will be have control of when the changes are pulled. If they are automatically pulled,
you run the risk of them being pulled when you are not ready for that to happen.
