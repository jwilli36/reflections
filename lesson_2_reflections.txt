When you initialize a repository you get the repitory ready to accept commits. You need the repository to track different changes 
within your code.

 How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
 I believe the staging area allows you the opportunity to change your mind about the files you want to place into the repository
 
 How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
 You can use the staging area by using get add on each file one at a time before actually committing a file.
 
 What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
 Branches would be helpful if you had to suddenly stop working on your existing project to work on something more urgent. Branches
 will help you keep track of your current work place.
