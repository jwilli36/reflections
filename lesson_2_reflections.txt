What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository you get the repitory ready to accept commits. You need the repository to track different changes 
within your code.

 How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
 I believe the staging area allows you the opportunity to change your mind about the files you want to place into the repository
