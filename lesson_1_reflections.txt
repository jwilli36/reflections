How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

The difference was easy to find and clearly their. It was very simple.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

If you are trying to upgrade a file or revert back to an old version it would much easier to find the file and make the wanted change.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions 
automatically saved, like Google docs does?

The a major pro would be that you have complete control of when the git is created. A major con would be that you create commits
too often which would cause difficulty at a future time within the project.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, 
treat each file separately?

I believe that different version control systems have different functions, therefore characteristics of one system
would not be needed in the other system. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

I can use the git log to see all the changes that have taken place. I can use the git diff files to see the 
differences between certain versions of those changes.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Version control gives you the ease of mind to know that you can always find a mistake that was made and correct it.


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I want to use get to learn how to find differences between files and learn whatever else there is to possibly learn about GIT.
